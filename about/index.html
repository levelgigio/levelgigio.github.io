<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming since 2013 when I began working with a robotics team called Equipe Jaguar, during my high school period. I have contributed with Equipe Jaguar for 2 years and we have won multiple competitions together, including the Brazilian Robotics Competition, which granted us the opportunity of competing in an internatinal competition only national winners can go, that took place in China,  called RoboCup.</p>
<p>Just after I got my technical degree in Industrial Automation, I began a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Engineering that i am currently enrolled. I did several projects for classes but I also did personal projects to add expertise to my curriculum. The one that I am most proud of is a innovative game of gambling built with ElectronJS, React and Sockets.io, called Prizeship, where players can vote on the directions a spaceship will take.</p>
<p>Currently I work with Business Intelligence at ExxonMobil, one of the world&rsquo;s largest oil and gas company, where I work on a daily basis with people from all around the world, delivering the solutions and the insights the company needs. Also, I am a member of UTFPR&rsquo;s programming club.</p>
<p>My passion is working with data, full-stack programming, design and automation.</p>
